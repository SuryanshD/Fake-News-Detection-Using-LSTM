# Fake News Detection using LSTM

This project aims to detect fake news using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for handling sequential data effectively. The LSTM model is trained on a dataset of news articles labeled as real or fake to classify new articles as trustworthy or misleading.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
- **LSTM Model Architecture**: Details of the LSTM network architecture used for fake news detection.
- **Training**: Instructions on how to train the LSTM model on your dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Methods for evaluating the model's performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Guidelines for deploying the trained model for inference on new news articles.
- **Visualization**: Techniques for visualizing model predictions and performance metrics.

## Requirements

Specify the necessary dependencies and libraries required to run the project:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- (Add any other dependencies specific to your project)

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset of labeled news articles and organize it appropriately.
2. **Model Training**: Train the LSTM model using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model's performance using predefined metrics.
4. **Inference**: Deploy the model to classify new news articles as real or fake.
